# Abstract
Gene network analysis has become a cornerstone in understanding complex biological systems,
offering insights into development, disease progression, and ecological dynamics. This study explores
the evolution of gene network analysis methods, from traditional equation-based and Bayesian
approaches to the integration of advanced statistical techniques emerging from Random Matrix
Theory (RMT). While conventional methods often struggle with scalability, are noise-sensitive, and
use subjective thresholding, RMT introduces a systematic and robust mechanism for automatic
threshold determination. The integration of RMT, particularly in the Molecular Ecological Network
Analysis (MENA) pipeline, enhances the construction of gene networks by improving robustness
and reducing bias while also removing noise. This approach provides deeper understanding of the
modularity and system dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional network methods and the
demands of modern biological data analysis. The study concludes by emphasizing the transformative
potential of RMT in gene network analysis and its applicability to broader biological and ecological
domains.
